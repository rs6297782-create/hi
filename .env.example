# This application requires users to provide their own API keys through the UI.
# No environment variables are needed for core functionality.
#
# Users will be prompted to enter:
# - Gemini 2.0 Flash API Key (from Google AI Studio)
# - Vercel API Token (from Vercel Account Settings)
#
# API keys are stored securely in the browser's localStorage and never sent to the server.
